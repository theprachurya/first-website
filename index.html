<h1> A test HTML file written to create a website</h1>

<p> This is a test HTML file written in order to better understand how Git works, and how files are pushed using it. </p>
<h2> This website may be modified into a new website in the future.</h2>
<p> If you're reading this in the future, either by commit history, or some other way, I hope you are not horrified by how bad I am at this. I am new to this, so this might be a fun easter egg in the commit history, incase I actually make a good website out of this repository. </p>
